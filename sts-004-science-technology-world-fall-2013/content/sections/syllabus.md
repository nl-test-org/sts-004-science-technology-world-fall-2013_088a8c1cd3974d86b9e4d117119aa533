Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Seminars: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This is a brand new class intended as an Introduction to STS Studies for undergraduates—something the STS Program has never offered before. You have the opportunity to take the class on its maiden voyage. This class was designed in detail by other MIT undergraduates who were enrolled in an upper-class STS seminar last fall. The team project throughout the term was to design an Intro to STS subject for undergraduates. In numerous ways the features of STS.004 reflect the collective wisdom of your fellow students, and you can add to that wisdom by giving the subject its first full workout.

Official Catalog Description: STS.004 introduces students to multidisciplinary studies in Science, Technology, and Society (STS), using four case studies to illustrate a broad range of approaches to basic principles of STS studies. Case studies vary from year to year, but always include a current MIT event. Other topics are drawn from legal and political conflicts, and arts and communication media. Teaching modes include guest presenters, discussion groups, field activities, visual media, and a practicum style of learning.

Prerequsites
------------

None.

Attendance
----------

Required.

If you miss any class due to an unavoidable conflict (such as a job interview), you need to discuss make-up work with the instructor in advance.

Laptop Policy
-------------

Please bring copies of your written work and of any readings to class, whether on a computer or in hard copy. You are welcome to use a computer in class so long as it is for class-related work only.

Academic Honesty
----------------

We will discuss MIT's principles and procedures as summarized in [MIT's Academic Integrity Handbook](https://integrity.mit.edu/), especially the sections on Academic Writing.

Collaboration is encouraged in discussing the work of the class. The work itself (writing papers, preparation of oral reports, taking quizzes) must be done on your own.

Assignments
-----------

Note that some short assignments are due the morning of the class day. This will allow time for the instructor to review them before class discussion in the afternoon.

### Papers

Session 3: Current event as STS

Session 12: Op-ed on Swartz case \[required revision due by session 24.\]

### Oral Presentations

Session 14: Further background / comment on Asilomar / Cambridge City Council

### Written and Oral

Session 6: MIT 150th Exhibit examples (3 items)

Session 20: Photography project

Sessions 25, 26: Student final reports

### Quiz

Session 7: Key words and concepts

There is no final exam

Grading
-------

All written work will be graded for content, organization, clarity, and correctness. If the work is careless, sloppy, or otherwise unacceptable, you will be required to revise it. One paper (the op-ed assignment) must be revised. All papers may be revised, with permission from and preliminary discussion with the instructor.
